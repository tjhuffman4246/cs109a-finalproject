# CS109A Final Project ([website](https://cs109group74.weebly.com))

## Collaborators: Matty Cheng and Chris Skokowski

This Python-based project was developed for the fall 2019 edition of CS109A, Harvard's "Introduction to Data Science." Using decision trees, random forests, and artificial neural networks, we attempted to predict the results of the 2018 U.S. House of Representatives elections (i.e., whether the winner would be a Democrat or a Republican). Our model had an accuracy rate of 89.2\%, which is more thoroughly described in our project website.

### data

Contains House election results since 1976, obtained from the Harvard Dataverse, and demographic data from the American Community Survey, from 2010 to 2018. Both are CSV files.

### data_clean

A cleaned version of `data`, still in CSV form. The result of data cleaning in `c109_project.ipynb`.

### data_out

The initial features and results of our random forest predictions from our Jupyter Notebook file.

### img_final

A collection of images used for our final project's website.

### `cs109_project.ipynb`

Python code for this project, contained in a Jupyter Notebook file.
