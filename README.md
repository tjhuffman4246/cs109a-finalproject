This Python-based project was developed for the fall 2019 edition of CS109A, Harvard's "Introduction to Data Science." Using decision trees, random forests, and artificial neural networks, we attempted to predict the results of the 2018 U.S. House of Representatives elections (i.e., whether the winner would be a Democrat or a Republican). Our model had an accuracy rate of 89.2\%, which is more thoroughly described in our project website.
